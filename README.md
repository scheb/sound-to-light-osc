sound-to-light-osc
==================

Real-time detection of beats with Python from an audio input device (typically "Stereo Mix"). Outputs OSC signals,
to be used for sound-to-light control.

It keeps track of the music "intensity" (calm, normal, intense) to switch lighting programs.

I use [QLC+](https://github.com/mcallegari/qlcplus) for DMX control.

Required modules
----------------

- PyAudio
- PyQt5
- PyQwt
- matplotlib
- scipy
- python-osc

Usage
-----

`python beatDetector.py`

OSC Signals
-----------

OSC signals are sent to `localhost:7701`, can be changed in `beatDetector.py`.

- `/beat` is sent for every beat detected.
- `/bar` is sent every to change the lighting scene.
- `/prog1` - `/prog8` is sent to change lighting programs (available have to be configured in `beatDetector.py`)

Contributing
------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! Glad you like it üòä

I typically do not accept contributions to this project, as I've built this for myself and it just works fine for
me the way it is. The project isn't intended to work for anyone but myself. I've put it onto GitHub in case
someone finds this useful. So if you need changes, feel free to fork the repository and modify it for your own
needs.

If you have an idea that you believe is worth integrating, please reach out first. I don't want you to work on 
things that I wouldn't merge.
